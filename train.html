                <h3> What is Live Train Running Status?</h3>
                <p> Live train running status for Indian railway trains means the current location of any train and its

                    the status updates from time to time. The train running status information becomes more and more
                    accurate, as the train is about to reach the estimated time of travel. This information helps you
                    save time and plan better!</p>
                <h3>How can we check Live Train Status? </h3>

                    delay status. Check train status through any modern day Internet-powered devices. If you are on a
                    train you can also check live train status being offline by switching to GPS mode for fetching live
                    train status. It recommends its users to use GPS mode while travelling on train for faster and more
